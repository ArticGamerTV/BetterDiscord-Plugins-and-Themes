#Plugins Info

##BetterAPI Plugin (![0_BetterAPI.js](https://github.com/Bluscream/BetterDiscord-Plugins-and-Themes/blob/master/plugins/0_BetterAPI.js))
Provides a better API mantained by me.

*This plugin is a requirement for most of my other plugins to work!*

##User Info Plugin (![1_userinfo.js](https://github.com/Bluscream/BetterDiscord-Plugins-and-Themes/blob/master/plugins/1_userinfo.js))
Gives you the ability to see more info about a user.

Still WiP (More features will be added soon)!

##Block User Plugin (![2_blockuser.js](https://github.com/Bluscream/BetterDiscord-Plugins-and-Themes/blob/master/plugins/2_blockuser.js))
Gives you the ability to block/unblock users

Still WiP (Buggy as hell :P)

##Fire Work Plugin (![3_firework.js](https://github.com/Bluscream/BetterDiscord-Plugins-and-Themes/blob/master/plugins/3_firework.js))
Does not work at all atm. Not my priority to fix.

Still WiP (Buggy as hell :P)
