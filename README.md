# BetterDiscord-Plugins-and-Themes
Unofficial Plugins and Themes for [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp)

This is a collection of plugins 'n themes. I'll try to keep them as up-to-date as possible.

Please note that not every single plugin/theme is by me. If i took your plugin/theme and you want to be credited somewhere here as author just tell me.


If you want to make plugin coding easier for me please support me [here](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp/issues/88) :)

Everything goes to ``` %appdata%\BetterDiscord\ ```
